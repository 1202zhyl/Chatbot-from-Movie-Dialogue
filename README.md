# Chatbot-from-Movie-Dialogue

I built a simple chatbot using conversations from Cornell University's [Movie Dialogue Corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). The main features of our model are LSTM cells, a bidirectional dynamic RNN, and decoders with attention. 

If you would like to learn a bit more about the details of this project, especially the sequence-to-sequence portion, I wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@Currie32/how-to-build-your-first-chatbot-c84495d4622d) about this.
